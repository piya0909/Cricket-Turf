# Cricket-Turf
This HTML code represents a full-fledged web page designed for booking a cricket ground. It includes a responsive navigation menu, a hero section for a call-to-action, a booking section with calendar and time slot selection, and a facilities section. Additionally, it features a login modal, mobile responsiveness, and interaction logic for the booking system.

Points of sections and there components:

* Navigation:

A mobile version of the navigation menu is included using a toggle button.

* Hero Section:

A large, full-screen background image with a call-to-action button to "Book Now" that scrolls the user to the booking section.

* Booking Section:

-Contains two parts:

A calendar to select the date. The calendar dynamically populates with days of the current month.

A time slot selection for available hours.

A booking form collects user details like name, email, phone number, and number of players.

A button to proceed to the payment page after filling out the form.

* Facilities Section:

Displays images and descriptions of the facilities like the turf, practice nets, and modern amenities.

* Login Modal:

A modal for logging in, triggered by the "Login" button in the navigation bar.

The modal contains a form for the user to input their email and password.

* JavaScript Functionality:

Mobile Menu Toggle: The mobile menu can be opened and closed by clicking a button.

Login Modal: Displays the login modal when the "Login" button is clicked, and closes it when the close button is pressed.

Calendar Generation: Dynamically generates the calendar for the current month, marking some days as booked.

Time Slot Generation: Shows available time slots for the selected date and allows the user to select a time slot.

* Potential Improvements:
-Date Selection Logic: You might want to refine how the user selects a date. For example, you could highlight the current date or prevent past dates from being selected.

-Backend Integration: To make this fully functional, you need to connect it to a backend system for real-time booking availability, storing user information, and processing payments.

-Accessibility: Adding aria-labels or other accessibility features would make the app more inclusive.

-Responsive Enhancements: While the layout seems mostly responsive, testing it across various screen sizes (especially on mobile devices) would be helpful to ensure a seamless experience.
